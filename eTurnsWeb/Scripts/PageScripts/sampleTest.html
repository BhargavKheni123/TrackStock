<p>"Our company just implemented a 700 scale eTurns eVMI Sensor-managed Inventory Solution at a large powergen manufacturer in Ohio. The customer was very impressed by the nearly $1M stock reduction and access to real-time on-hand inventory data."<br /><em>—</em><em>Robert Connors, CEO</em></p>
<p>"eTurns pays for itself within 1-2 months of each new customer installation and it allows us to stock 35% less inventory at our customers’ stockrooms because of the visibility it provides."<br /><em>—Ray Herzog, Chief Commercial Leader</em></p>
<p>"eTurns helped us create an amazing consigned RFID solution for our customer. As wind turbine parts are driven by forklift through the portal, eTurns automatically records consumption and lets us invoice immediately while replenishing as needed. The solution has provided tremendous cost savings – replacing the need to employ three people to support the customer need for 24 hour support."<br /><em>—</em><em>Autrie Bacon, Global Supply Chain Solution Manager</em></p>
<p>"Over the past 10 years we have periodically taken a look to see if there were better remote storeroom inventory management solutions than what eTurns provides and each time we came up empty. ERP providers are too expensive and cumbersome and other inexpensive cloud software for inventory management was not as full-featured as eTurns"<br /><em>—</em><em>Autrie Bacon, Global Supply Chain Solution Manager</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Digikey</h4>
<p>"Since we’ve starting using eTurns with our customers 4 years ago, we’ve grown revenues over 20% with these customers due to just how simple they make it to track consigned inventory. Equally important, eTurns support is one of the best I have experienced."<br /><em>—</em><em>Steve Vecchiarelli, VP Supply Chain</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Humana</h4>
<p>"<span>It's user-friendly, has easy navigation, an accessible platform, is versatile, and offers exceptional customer service. It's been great. We now have the ability to streamline our ordering, tracking, and replenishment process."</span></p>
<p><em><span>—Jeremy H., Network Administrator Technician</span></em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Rexel</h4>
<p>"<span>We use the mobile app to scan material weekly. I love that the system will use those counts to determine how much material has been used, what needs to be replenished, and the availability of reports for usage and frequency of orders. We handle VMI for one of our largest customers. eTurns has allowed us to provide a service to our customer by stocking inventory at their facility and keeping track of it with eTurns. This service, with eTurns capabilities, allow us to stock and sell more product for this customer. It also makes it easy to bill them weekly for material used and facilitate replenishment of material in a timely manner.</span>"<br /><em>—</em><em>Tim A., Assistant Branch Manager</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Lakes Region EMS</h4>
<p>"We were using a completely manual process that led to a stockroom filled with unused supplies and lots of stuff expiring. Switching to eTurns demonstrated significant change in a short period of time. The value of our inventory on hand was north of $75,000 when we started using the system; now we have around $20,000 sitting on the shelves. The drain on my time has been significantly reduced and continues to improve."<br /><em>—</em><em>Brian Galowitz, Minnesota Operations Manager</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Service America - Service Trucks</h4>
<p>"eTurns has live capture of parts usage, unlike our ERP. With eTurns on our 75 service trucks, we decreased line items on each truck from 315 to 170 and the amount of inventory on each truck from $20k to $14k. eTurns helped me streamline procurement so that my carrying costs went from $1.6M to $875K, for a savings of $725,000 a year. We reduced our 8 people in procurement to 3 and redeployed those people to dispatch and customer service."  <em><br />—Carlos Echazabal, Sr. Director of Operations <br /></em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">SourceOne Technologies</h4>
<p>"eTurns optimized our inventory and drastically reduced the number of POs we needed to create, saving us $31,000 the first year — which created an ROI of 900%."<br /><em>—</em><em>Rhonda Einck, Senior/Buyer Planner</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Cupertino Electric</h4>
<p>"Cupertino Electric has recognized increased productivity and cost savings as a result of installing a consignment eTurns/OasisPro site in our prefab facility. “Just in time inventory” means we have the material on the shelf, when we need it. We also have the ability to easily cost material to our various jobs utilizing the customer defined fields the eTurns tool offers. eTurns, working in conjunction with EDI, allows for a seamless flow of material and invoicing between our distributor and us."<br /><em>—</em><em>Allen Bender, Purchasing Agent</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Rexel Canada</h4>
<p>"Within the first few weeks of launching our eTurns solution, we were able to bid on and WIN a customer contract that mandated a remote stockroom management tool. eTurns made the difference!"<br /><em>—</em><em>Mark Durant, Director of New Business Development</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red"><a href="https://www.gexpro.com/usg/oasis-insight">Gexpro ED</a></h4>

The solution plays well in a unique niche that very few other offerings compete well in. The company provides great support that is intimate and personal while their product is the best we have seen in this space."<br /><em>—</em><em>Jeremy Kren, National Customer Solutions Manager</em></p>

<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Anixter</h4>
<p>"If the customer didn’t have eTurns we could not control the consigned inventory at the customer’s location. eTurns provides a great way to record the parts the customer used so we can bill them. Without it, we would have a lot more confusion and negotiations with customers."<br /><em>—</em><em>Ignacio Valdes</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Arbell Electronics</h4>
<p>"Very user friendly and very easy to download info from the system. Great support from them. Easy to use product. There is nothing to dislike."<br /><em>—</em><em>Lee Wise, President</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">TTI</h4>
<p>"We’ve used eTurns/3 remote storeroom inventory software for several years. We use it to help us manage the consigned inventories at our customer accounts. eTurns allows us to invoice on consumption, replenish as necessary and use one set of books to reconcile inventory. eTurns provides a very smooth way to track exactly what the customer used and needs to pay for."<br /><em>—</em><em>Ben Lasoi, Analyst</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Electrical Wholesale Supply Co.</h4>
<p>"The support, from the initial start-up and follow up to operational issues has been very good. The staff of eTurns have been very responsive to our needs and support of the site.

There is a feeling a TEAM in our relationship."<br /><em>—</em><em>Alex Cross, E-Commerce Assistant Branch Manager</em></p>
<h4 class="text-eturns-red">Wolf Creek Company</h4>
<p>"First off eTurns works. A simple app with a lot of capability. Second, the team is wonderful to work with. Responsive and able. Any issues, needs, or questions were quickly dealt with. We needed a tool to capture and transmit pulls from a consigned inventory. Had to be quick and EASY for our customer, eTurns is. Also need that information transmitted automatically into our P21 system as an order."<br /><em>—</em><em>Scott Knowles, President</em></p>
